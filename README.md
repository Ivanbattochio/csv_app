# CSV APP for Shaw and Partners

Unfortunately, i didn't dispose of much time to finish a lot of the test requirements, but i hope i was able to show some of my skills even though i didn't code as best as i could because i knew i wasn't going to be able deliver everything with the time i had.

The main missing points, due to lack of time:

-   Automated tests
-   Search trough the uploaded csv data
-   Better front-end for sure, i know it's looking horrible
-   I wanted to do the function to navigate through the already uploaded csv files (hence the column in the left displaying all the files uploaded)

Overall i think i was able to show a little of my front/back end skills (especially in the backend), even though the app is not 100% functional.

The front end code is located in the client folder and the back end code is located in the server folder. The mongodb password is in the env.

To run both is only necessary "npm i" and "npm run dev".
